# Group Meeting 2024-02-20

## Participants

- John Sundh
- Jarone Pinhassi

## Available data
	
- The team has several constructed MAGs (Metagenome Assembled Genomes) from different datasets (see e.g. [Alneberg et al 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0856-x)). Some of these have already been dereplicated but some may still need to be integrated into the full set of MAGs.
- Thereâ€™s also peptide spectra data that should be mapped to the MAG catalog, we should find out if there is expertise in NBIS on how to do this efficiently.
- There is also data from viral metagenomics, sequenced from the fraction passing through the 0.22 um filter.

## Strategy

- Map metagenomes (MG), metatranscriptomes (MT) and metaproteomes (MP) to the MAG catalog, and potentially also the Baltic Sea gene catalog already constructed.
- Nf-core pipelines of interest here are e.g. metatdenovo which is being developed by Daniel Lundin and others.
- Since this is essentially an integrative project we should look into methods designed for the task.


## Action points

- [ ] Locate search paths to data on Uppmax and share these with NBIS (Jarone)
- [ ] Consult NBIS internally to find out if anyone knows of good ways to map peptide spectra to a database of protein sequences
